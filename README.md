## Introduction

[PhotoStudy](https://www.photostudy.co/) is a platform created by Got It, Inc. in 2011 that allows students to seek help with their homework problems from experienced tutors around the world in 1-on-1 sessions. The Operations team of Got It (hereinafter referred to as Got It Ops team) is in charge of ensuring the quality of PhotoStudy tutors' performances using various types of metrics, e.g., ratings given by students for their tutors.

## Problem Statement

We are tasked with investigating the reasons behind an unexpected increase of low ratings (from 4% to 10%) from PhotoStudy users during Week 4 of October 2022 (see Problem Statement sheet in Dataset.xlsx file for more details). <br />

***Disclaimer: This analysis is based on a fictional scenario and conducted with a dummy dataset, both provided by Got It Ops team themselves.*** <br />
